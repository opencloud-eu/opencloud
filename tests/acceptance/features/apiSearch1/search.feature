Feature: Search
  As a user
  I want to search for resources in the space
  So that I can get them quickly

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
    And using spaces DAV path
    And the administrator has assigned the role "Space Admin" to user "Alice" using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a space "project101" with the default quota using the Graph API
    And user "Alice" has created a folder "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2" in space "project101"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded a file inside space "project101" with content "some content" to "folderMain/SubFolder1/subFOLDER2/insideTheFolder.txt"

  Scenario Outline: report extra properties in search entries for a folder
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    When user "Alice" searches for "*folderMain*" using the WebDAV API requesting these properties:
      | oc:fileid             |
      | oc:permissions        |
      | d:getlastmodified     |
      | d:getetag             |
      | d:getcontenttype      |
      | oc:size               |
      | oc:owner-id           |
      | oc:owner-display-name |
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And folder "folderMain" in the search result of user "Alice" should contain these properties:
      | name                  | value                                                                                             |
